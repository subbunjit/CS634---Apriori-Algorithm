# CS634-Apriori-Algorithm
Java Implementation of Apriori Algorithm 
Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over transactional databases. 
It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database.

# Usage
Here, we create  10 items usually seen in Amazon, K-mart, or any other supermarkets (e.g. diapers, clothes, etc.). Have attached the sample file containing list of items for Amazon and k-mart.
These files are given as input to the program from where it calculates the association rules and the input transactions for each of the databases which we created.
